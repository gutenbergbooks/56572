</div>
<p>One of the most interesting and
instructive phenomena in the lessons
of nature is the falling of the dew&mdash;a
seeming miracle which begins with the
setting of the sun, and goes on mysteriously,
collecting and distributing its countless
exquisite water jewels, all through the long
stillness of the night, only to be dispelled
again by the heat of the rising sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>We are more or less familiar, through
casual observation, with the varied beauties
of the dew. A walk in the country or
park, in the early midsummer morning,
just after the sun has risen, if possible,
will enable you fully to appreciate its
charms; especially if the dewfall during
the preceding night has been a copious
one. Every bit of plant-life and vegetation
will sparkle and twinkle in the early
sunshine, hung and embellished with millions
of glittering jewels. The very smallest
grass blade, you will discover, has not
been neglected by the Dew Fairy. And
even the delicate, gossamer-like spider&rsquo;s
web swung from twig to twig or caught
among the grasses, is dew laden, and an
object of beauty well worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>Happy indeed are you, if you have
enjoyed a stroll in an old-fashioned country
flower garden in the early morning.
No need to dwell upon its charms if you
have enjoyed that pleasure, for you will
long remember the refreshment and peace
which came to you with the close companionship
of the great pink, damask
roses, their petals still heavy with the
night dews; the tall, sentinel-like lilies,
cool and fragrant, their cups filled with
dewy nectar, which great blundering bees
were eagerly plundering; clean-smelling
phlox, waist-high, each velvet cluster moist
and bent with its weight of dew. Then the
beds of gray-green mignonette; and best of
all, down in an out-of-the-way corner, a
tangle of unobtrusive old-fashioned pinks,
where you knelt and buried your face for
a moment to inhale their spicy fragrance,
and found them doubly sweet and satisfying
after their drenching dew bath.
While the beds of simples and humbler
things, the sage and wormwood, with their
silvery leaves heavy with dew, exhaled a
pungent, aromatic odour as you brushed
them in passing. For the dew had refreshed
them and enhanced their dormant spiciness
tenfold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The phenomenon of the dew is simply
explained, and well worthy of a short study
as it is really a most important factor in
nature&rsquo;s laws. Simply explained, the dew
is really an actual deposit of water from
the atmosphere upon the surface of the
earth, and is formed when the earth
is sufficiently cooled during the night
by radiation.</p>
<p>Upon a pleasant day during summer,
especially if the sun shines brightly, much
aqueous vapour or mist is held suspended
in the air, and if the temperature at sunset
falls below the dew point, that vapour
can no longer be retained in suspension
in the air, and falls to the earth. The
dew is the vapour of the air. Sometimes
it can readily be seen falling in a fine mist
resembling rain. It is the humidity of the
air deposited upon all surfaces of the earth
with which it comes in contact. When
the temperature falls below the dew point,
or 32&deg;, the dew then becomes converted
into frost, and we have a deposit of hoar
frost, instead of the dew. It has been
remarked that horizontal and flat surfaces
exposed to the dew receive a greater
deposit than sheltered or oblique surfaces.</p>

<p>Dew has frequently been quoted as
&ldquo;A shower from heaven,&rdquo; but this is
not literally correct. True, it appears
rather mysteriously from a clear sky, and
upon a still, cloudless night covers thickly
every blade of grass and plant life with
seeming raindrops, and that frequently
where rain clouds rarely appear, and the
rain seldom falls. In such climates,
where a rainfall is rare, it is certainly a
most beneficial and wise provision, for it
gathers upon all herbage and vegetation,
in sparkling, refreshing profusion; while
it avoids instinctively all barren rocky
formations and all things which could
not be benefited by its grateful cooling,
moisture. Also, in cold, damp climates,
where the air is continually saturated with
moisture, and where an additional amount
is not required, the gathering clouds and
the dampness of the chilly atmosphere
prevent a radiation of heat from the earth,
and the dew never falls in such climates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>There are three requisites which appear
to be essential for the formation of the
dew: First, that the air should be moist;
second, that the surface upon which it
falls shall be cold, and third, that the sky
be clear.</p>
<p>Of course the atmosphere always contains
a greater amount of moisture after
a rainfall, when the air has been greatly
cooled. Evaporation is then continually
going on among all objects lying near the
surface of the earth. Blades of grass
and all plants near the ground gradually
cool and assume a lower temperature after
sunset; they are preparing for the fall
of the dew.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that certain plants
possess greater powers of radiating heat
and of expelling moisture through evaporative
process than others; upon such plants
the dew deposit is always more profuse,
while those plants possessing less powers
of radiation and evaporation, collect little
dew.</p>

<p class="caption">14. Dew upon the down of a leaf</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>There are very many plants whose leaves
are downy, with a thick growth of tiny
vegetable hairs; the mullein leaf is a
good example, its thick velvety leaves are
thickly covered with this growth of vegetable
down, and present a velvety surface;
these leaves always collect a fine display
of dew jewels. One has been caught by
the camera, perched upon the down of
a mullein leaf, as shown in the photographic
illustration.</p>
<p>During still nights in early spring and fall,
when there are no disturbing winds, the water
molecules or dewdrops in countless numbers
form one upon another, all night long, and
settle upon blades of grass and all growing
plants, and in the morning sunshine dance
and sparkle in strings of scintillating diamonds
from every pasture and hedge row.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The sharp-pointed grasses collect the
dew very copiously and in a most interesting
manner. Dewdrops formed upon
the grass blades, it will be observed, are
arranged in a truly wonderful symmetrical
fashion, and one marvels at the orderly
arrangement. Frequently one large dewdrop,
clear as a diamond, is deposited
upon the very tip of the little grass
blade, sometimes two and even three large
drops are held in suspension thus, while
upon the extreme sharp edge of one or
both sides of the blade a collection of small,
bead-like drops cling in orderly, precise
fashion, strung from tip to root of the grass
blade. A broken or blunted blade of
grass collects no dew, or very little. When
the large dewdrop perched upon the tip
of the grass blade decides to fall, it descends
rather slowly at first, following the extreme
edge of the blade in its course, and thus
meets and collects all the other dewdrops
which it encounters strung along the edge
of the blade, until forming at last one
heavy drop, it suddenly falls to earth, where
it is instantly absorbed, and goes to give
life and strength to the very roots of the
plant.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Cobwebs attract the dew in a rather
singular manner. It is yet to be discovered
why the dew forms only upon
the horizontal threads of a spider&rsquo;s web,
while the vertical threads, though smaller,
collect no dew deposit. This curious fact
is well shown in the photograph of the
entire spider&rsquo;s web, also in the section of a
web, showing the dew deposit in detail.
Wonderfully beautiful are these dew-laden
webs. It will be observed that each drop
is similar in size, and closely resembles
several strings of well-matched pearls,
although in the sunshine they appear as
clear, flashing diamonds. Certain leaves
collect the dew drops in a novel manner,
notably the strawberry leaf, and similar
plants having serrate edges. The strawberry
leaf, besides being plentifully decorated
upon its surface with water beads, holds
in each tiny serration about its edge a
large, clear, sparkling dewdrop, which gives
the leaf a wonderful jewelled effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>We are all familiar with the so-called
&ldquo;sweating&rdquo; of a glass or pitcher, or a
metal pipe containing cold water; this is
another phase of the dew, and may be
observed in the daytime.</p>
<p>A cool night in spring or autumn, after
a hot day, we usually receive a more
copious fall of dew, which gradually increases
as the night becomes cooler.
Should clouds gather, the precipitation
of the dew at once ceases. Wherever a
bush or bit of vegetation overhangs a spot,
it has a similar effect to that of a cloud,
and the dew does not collect at all, or
not as copiously, in that spot.</p>
<p>In the tropics, and in certain countries
where there are no rain clouds; where
they rarely have rain for many months
at a time, the dewfall is so heavy that it
quite supplies the lack of rainfall. If it
were not for this providential visitation
of the dew all vegetable life must certainly
perish, scorched and withered by the torrid
heat.</p>

<p>In the East, in the region of Palestine,
the dew frequently is so heavy that it
closely resembles rain. Upon the great
burning deserts alone the dew never
falls; for the moment the dew vapours or
molecules encounter the scorching breath
which arises from the face of these barren
seas of sand, they evaporate and are
redissolved, dissipated and consumed by
the heat. So it will be seen that the
fixed molecules which compose vegetation
alone have the power to attract and arrest
the water molecules of the air with which
they come in contact, and thus form, in
combination, the dew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>When the temperature is below 32&deg;, the
tiny particles which go to form the dew
become hoar frost. It is often of great
value to the farmer or vegetable grower
to be able to know just the temperature
of the dew point, because, if he discovers
it in time, he is enabled to save his garden
from a sudden blighting visitation of the
frost.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact, and one which
is known to few of us, but which may
readily be seen, if we take time to study
the dewdrop minutely is; that each tiny
drop of dew is in itself a miniature mirror,
for upon its clear, crystal-like surface it
holds and faithfully portrays upon its
rounded form the image of any near-by
object. The picture is, of course, naturally
inverted. But you will find it; a bit of
blue sky holding a scrap of fleecy cloud,
or a pigmy forest of trees caught and
mirrored in the dewdrop. Often sleeping
and dormant insects when caught out in
the open during the night, receive a copious
deposit of dew. The caterpillar shown
in the photograph was a good subject,
and quite a collection of dew was deposited
upon his furry coat.</p>

<p>When autumn has reached the zenith
of perfection, when the milkweeds
and thistles which grow thick in the hedges
have cast their gossamer, fairy-like seeds
to the winds, and the goldenrod which
flaunted its yellow banners so brightly
through those last long, perfect days of
dying autumn, has at last begun to fade,
the first warning which we have of the
approach of the frost is all at once seen
in certain mysterious changes of colour
which have taken place in the foliage of the
trees. Then we know that upon that
last still night, when the stars snapped
and sparkled so brilliantly, and the air
felt unusually keen and crisp, that the
Hoar-frost Spirit must have been abroad,
and in passing, touched all the trees and
plants very lightly with his magic wand.
Out in the garden the sturdy sunflowers
droop their seed-filled crowns a trifle, while
the hollyhocks seem to stand less primly
and firmly, and lean together as though
for support. They have felt the blighting
touch of that magic wand. He touched
also the tips of the maple leaves upon
the hillside, and left upon some of them
just a little dab of his crimson brushwork;
they form a touch of brilliant colour
against the darkly massed pines and hemlocks
in the background. But shortly they
will flame forth upon every hillside, one
vast torch, lighted to do honour to the
passing of autumn; and all the work of
the Frost Spirit.</p>

<p>The little sour fox-grapes which grow
in the hedge-rows, are now piquant in
flavour, and have acquired something which
they lacked before, and are pleasant to
the taste since the hoar frost&rsquo;s visit to
them. The bitter-sweet berries which grow
close beside them, tangled and twisted
with the gray, fluffed-out clematis plumes,
have burst their orange-coloured sheaths,
and gleam more vividly than before. And
the great green chestnut burs are bursting,
just a trifle; they need one more, slightly
sharper touch from the hoar frost, and then
the plump, brown, satin-skinned nuts will
come tumbling out of their burs to the
ground. The eager squirrels have already
begun to collect their winter supplies.
They are early at work, even before the
magical display created by the hoar frost
has been touched by the sun. They mean
to get ahead of the children in their nut
gathering, if possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>If you too, would rise with the squirrels,
and go forth into the open fields and woods,
you will be amply repaid for the small
effort which it cost you, for the display
which the delicate hoar frost makes upon
a clear morning in early autumn, when
first touched by the sunrise, is really
fantastic and wonderfully beautiful.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in the country,
direct your steps across the pasture lands,
where the short thick grass is powdered
heavily with the hoar frost, and do not
fail to pause at the old, gray rail fence,
leading into the cornfield, to study the
fine effects, the magic work which the Frost
Spirit has left there during the night. The
withered brown shocks of corn, standing
in suggestive, witch-like attitudes, scattered
over the fields, each lance-like rustling
blade tipped with a steely, glittering
coat of frost; while between the leaning
stacks gleam great golden pumpkins, as
yet unharvested, each golden sphere gleaming
through a bluish-white deposit of hoar
frost, or frozen dew.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, James Whitcomb Riley
had in mind a similar scene when he was
inspired to pen the homely lines so often
quoted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When the frost is on the punkin,</p>
<p class="t0">And the fodder&rsquo;s in the shock.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The beauties and peculiarities of the
hoar-frost crystals are a distinctly separate
study in themselves, as they do not belong,
nor are they classified with the heavier
frosts of late and mid-winter, such as
we find in the extreme cold weather
deposited upon our window-panes and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The hoar frost is in reality the dew
particles or molecules of water in the air,
which, when the temperature falls below
32&deg;, freezes and collects, and thus forms
a deposit of hoar frost upon nearly all
surfaces which it encounters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Still another variety of hoar frost is that
which forms mysteriously under some covering;
occasionally we find it deposited
upon a bit of wood which has lain under
the snow; it forms upon the underside
of the wood, or that part resting upon the
ground, and is caused by the moisture
of the earth, which collects, and which
the temperature converts into crystals
of hoar frost.</p>
<p>Special and interesting examples of hoar-frost
formations are given in the photographic
illustrations, which, being taken
with a camera having a microscopic attachment
are, for the most part, largely
magnified. The detail and formation of
the hoar-frost crystal is most delicate,
and well worthy of study, and the curious
manner in which some of them are found,
also the many different shapes which they
assume, clearly shows that each formation
is possessed of certain individuality of
structural form peculiar to its environments,
and the surrounding objects to
which it may attach itself.</p>

<p class="caption">36. Showing initials crudely scratched upon glass, which frost has elaborated</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>An especially interesting type of crystal
is that which grows in queer needle-like
layers, somewhat suggestive of tiny stalactite
growths; this variety we frequently
discover in gravelly or peaty soil, while
it sometimes raises and supports upon its
points large sections of earth and stones.</p>
<p>These needle-like columnar formations,
which are excellently portrayed in the
illustrations, are often found from two
to six inches in height, and are formed
from the moisture which rises from the
warm soil and freezes. These columnar
crystals do not form in this manner in the
extremely cold weather, or after the ground
has become solidly frozen to a certain
depth; therefore they may be classed
among the hoar-frost formations of early
autumn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>As shown in detail in the photographs,
the formation of each section of this type
of hoar-frost crystal appears as a prism-like
columnar growth, the base of the
prism being hexagonal in shape, and closely
resembling an unset jewel.</p>
<p>Through the still, cool nights in autumn
the Hoar-frost Fairy works steadily, covering
vegetation with glittering frost-work,
touching all unsightly places, decaying
woods, old gray fence-rails lightly in passing,
and upon the following morning, if you are
fortunately stirring before the sun ruins
the best work of the hoar frost, you will
discover many wonderful works of art.
Sometimes it will be a miniature, scintillating
forest of needle-like crystals attaching
itself to some old rail. Again a perfectly
marvellous collection which you may find
deposited upon a board; tiny tabular ice
crystals of hoar frost closely resembling
a flight of white butterflies or moths
powdered over its flat surface. We were
fortunately able to secure one of this type;
and with the aid of a small pocket microscope,
you may be able to discover this
pleasing variety, as shown in our photograph.
The same variety of hoar frost
was again encountered, where the delicate
crystals had formed and grouped themselves
upon a stick or straw; this is wonderfully
suggestive of a group of butterflies
resting upon a flower-stalk, as we
frequently observe them in mid-summer,
where flights of the yellow wayside butterflies
assemble upon a mullein-stalk in
precisely the same fashion.</p>

<p class="caption">37. An exquisite lace pattern in frost</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The showy illustration resembling in
formation a branch of bleached coral, is
another interesting example of the hoar
frost&rsquo;s eccentric development, and was found
clinging to a decaying beam, under an old
building.</p>
<p>The beautiful feathery spray, somewhat
resembling a miniature fir tree, was taken
from the branch of a tree, about which it
had formed, and is made up of countless,
lace-like, filmy ice prisms, of infinite delicacy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Much is lost in the scintillating iridescence
of these frail hoar-frost crystals when seen
merely in the photographs, for they frequently
show rare colour effects when
seen in the open.</p>
<p>That the hoar frost sometimes takes
strange freaks is shown in the exquisitely
beautiful deposits occasionally found upon
the edges of a piece of broken ice. Sometimes
you will discover it upon the thin,
new ice which forms upon small streams
in the early autumn, and in gullies beside
the road. This ice is short-lived, and
readily breaks at the slightest touch, with
the crackling sound of broken glass. A
section of this thin ice is shown, about
the ragged edge of which the hoar frost
has arranged itself in fantastic fashion.
The dark waters of the brook may be seen
through the opening.</p>

<p>Hoar frost which gathers upon the grass
blades, unlike the deposit of the dew,
does not form noticeably upon the tips of
the blades; on the contrary, the hoar frost
gathers in an apparently greater and heavier
degree the nearer to the earth it approaches.
Flat-leaved, low-growing plants are usually
well covered with hoar-frost crystals, while
about the edges of certain leaves a heavy
decoration of film-like crystals is sometimes
seen.</p>
<p>Frequently upon a pond of frozen water
we come across a queer moss-like fungus
deposit scattered at intervals over the
surface of the ice. This is still another
type of hoar-frost formation. Still another
is the columnar frost crystal, which
is formed of clusters of needles, and these
loose, needle-like formations we frequently
find scattered over the surface of thin
brook ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>During your rambles in the autumn,
after the arrival of the hoar frost, it would
prove a pastime as well as an instructive
nature study, to search out and locate
the many different varieties of hoar frost.
Be sure to take a small pocket microscope
or reading lens with you. Search diligently
in unexpected places, beneath blocks
of wood, about decaying logs and old tree
stumps, for in all sorts of out of the way
places you will encounter them. Under
the edge of a stone, imbedded even in the
snow, and scattered over the surface of
frozen pond and brook. The Frost Spirit
seeks all sorts of strange nooks and crannies
in which to deposit its fascinating mushroom
growths.</p>
<p>Nature has in store for us many strange,
agreeable surprises. Among them there
is much to be discovered and learned about
these delicate fantastic creations deposited
by the Hoar-frost Spirit.</p>

<p>In zero weather, in mid-winter, when
the earth is frozen to a great depth
below the surface, when in driving over
the unpaved country roads they give forth
a hard metallic ring; when the trees are
all stripped of their coverings, with the
exception of a few forlorn brown leaves,
which cling tenaciously to the skeleton
branches, which crack and sway in the
chilly blasts; then indeed we may be fully
assured that nature has utterly succumbed
to the advances of the Frost King, and
that &ldquo;Jack Frost&rdquo; himself has arrived in
earnest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>How he tweaks and nips exposed ears
and noses, and how they tingle and ache
because of his stinging caress. Jack Frost,
we read, is &ldquo;the very personification of
frost and cold.&rdquo; All of us are more or less
familiar with the mischievous pranks of
Jack Frost, and they are quite separate
and apart from those of the gentle white
hoar frost, which is frequently seen early
in autumn, upon the first still, cool mornings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Frost,&rdquo; as the great Frost Spirit
is familiarly known the world over, is a
most important, if rather mythical personage,
and very few of us are really familiar
with the works which he creates in his
more serious moods, and the really wonderful
methods which he displays. For, with
all his mischief-making, he finds abundant
opportunity to work out and display
much really fine artistic ability in his
choice etchings and decorative schemes.</p>

<p>The night time seems to be most favourable
for the finest efforts of Jack Frost;
usually in mid-winter or early spring. He
prefers to select a still, cold night, zero
weather, for his best out-of-door display,
but it is usually in the coldest winter
weather that he applies his very choicest
designs upon the glass of our windows,
and just how charming and interesting
they are, you may judge by the photographed
designs herein shown.</p>
<p>Upon a still moonlit night, when Jack
Frost is astir, if you chance to be out
of doors, especially in the open country,
you will be made aware of his presence
in many ways besides the tingling of your
ears. Suddenly a sharp mysterious report
will occur in the forest, and a great tree
trunk is cleft mysteriously in twain. Again
an ominous cracking, as loud as a rifle
report comes from the still ice-covered pond.
It is merely Jack Frost indulging in a bit
of rifle-practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>That barren field, brown and unattractive
by daylight, how it glistens and
scintillates as the moonlight floods it. All
last summer&rsquo;s withered seed pods and
grasses; the fluffed-out goldenrod, and
many others are rejuvenated and hung
with sparkling, pendent ropes of jewels,
all the creation and work of the Frost
Spirit, who has simply paused to caress
them with his icy breath, in passing, and
lo, they are beautiful. Later, when the
morning sun touches them, they all, like
Cinderella, are shorn of their finery, and
become as before, just mere commonplace,
brown and withered seed pods again. But
with infinite patience, as soon as it is twilight
the following night, the Frost Spirit
steals forth again and restores once more
his magic, fantastic pictures by the rays
of the wintry moonlight.</p>

<p>The heavy frosts are a recognised and
most important factor in creating remarkable
changes in rocky formations of the
earth&rsquo;s surface. Large masses of rock are
constantly being split and reconstructed
by its mighty blasting powers, and great
sections of solid material are converted in
the same manner into soil by the secret
action of the frost, which works continually
with the other elements of heat and water
to effect these changes. These powerful
agents working year after year cause vast
and important changes to occur in the
formation of mountains and valleys. So
great is the power of frost, that it has
frequently been utilised in blasting; when
water being poured into the crevice of a
great rock, and allowed to freeze, the rock
was readily split, as desired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>All vegetation succumbs readily to the
withering blight of the frost with the
exception of the evergreen varieties. The
cause for this is, that the juices of plants
naturally expand when touched by the
frost, and at last burst, which destroys the
vesicles or life of the plant, which soon
blackens and dies. Of all the pranks in
which Jack Frost indulges, his wholesale
destruction of the beautiful flowers and
plants is the greatest to be deplored.
But with all the marvellous works of the
mighty Frost Spirit, nothing is quite so
fascinating and interesting as the curious
phenomena or frost formations which he
creates and deposits upon the window-panes
in mid-winter. Jack Frost is a
finished artist, I assure you, and his etchings
are dainty and attractive beyond words.</p>
<p>If you have entered an unlighted room,
and seen the moonlight filtering palely
through a frost-etched window; then you
know its charm. How it glittered and
sparkled, the delicate frostwork. You were
attracted no doubt and marvelled at the
dainty tracings, but few of us have really
had an opportunity to study the detail
of these frost designs minutely, or have
considered that there were more than three
or four designs at most.</p>

<p>It is only quite recently, in fact, that the
beautiful etchings of Jack Frost have been
classified and photographed in all their
perfection. Happily this has now been
accomplished, by the aid of a compound
photographic camera, and it opens up a
new and fascinating field to the camera
expert as well as to the student of frost
crystals. Marvellous indeed is the variety
and detail displayed in these attractive
window-pane etchings furnished by the
Frost Spirit, and if one is housed some
day, in mid-winter, zero weather, one may
watch the entire growth and development
of these exquisite frost etchings from start
to finish.</p>
<p>To do this, place a lamp or candle before
a frost-covered window, in a cold room,
or unheated by furnace, of course not near
enough to the glass to crack it, but just
close enough to melt the heavy frost curtain
which may have formed previously
upon the glass. After this has been allowed
to dissolve gradually, you will observe
a thin water film or formation which
has been left upon the outer edge of the
glass, the centre of which will be clear.
Do not disturb this film, for it is in part
from this that the frost crystallisations
form and develop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>As soon as you move the lamp away
from the glass, the pictures instantly
begin to grow and develop. Delicate,
feathery etchings of ice crystals first appearing
around the outer edge of the water
film, and according to the temperature of
the room, form rapidly or slowly. Exquisite
tracings, and fern-like leaves shoot out as
by magic toward the centre of the glass, but
as soon as they reach a dry place upon
the glass, they instantly cease. If you
observe very closely, you will discover
that meanwhile, in the little open spaces,
between the bolder fern-like designs,
more delicate feathery forms are gradually
appearing, formations which sometimes
resemble fine coral branches. As soon as the
water-film ice crystallisations are completed
they are closely followed by the true frost
crystals, which form upon the various
dry places upon the glass, delicate lines and
stars and also in a thin, dew-like deposit,
which rapidly freezes, and assumes a granular,
snow-like form. This granular frost
develops very rapidly, and soon covers all
the unoccupied, clear, dry places; but one
curious fact worthy of observation: it does
not intrude upon, or approach near to
the separate and individual designs or
masterpieces, of the frost already formed
upon the glass, but rather draws away
from their immediate vicinity. This strange
habit of the granular frost is well shown
in the photographed illustration, where
it will be observed that the granular frost
acts merely as a background or sky effect
for the real frost pictures, as in a painting.</p>

<p>Classified, there are about ten distinct
types of the window-pane frost. Representatives
of each and all types never appear
at any given time upon one window; and
strangely enough the designs are never
precisely alike on any two panes of glass.
Reduplications of any previous design are
extremely rare, and would only occur
when a multitude of identical conditions
occur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>This is rather singular, when we consider
the different factors which go to
form the window-pane frost. Certain panes
of glass vary in thickness and in surface
topography, also in the arrangement
of minute, invisible scratches, and the
accumulation of dust particles which
collect from day to day, all of which affect
the arrangement and collection of the frost
crystals. It has been observed that double
windows and furnace-heated apartments
are not favourable to frost formations;
but in rooms which are allowed to cool off
at night, and in rural dwelling houses
which are not heated by steam or furnace
the Frost Spirit loves to work, and decorates
their windows with his choicest etchings.</p>

<p>The beautiful frost studies illustrating
this chapter were photographed in northern
Vermont, where the winters are long and
the cold very intense; affording the very
best opportunities possible for the development
and study of the frost etchings.
These studies are, of course, somewhat
magnified, yet you will have no
difficulty in recognising many familiar frost
designs.</p>
<p><a href="#pic35">No. 35</a> is a linear type, and of rather
common occurrence, easily recognisable.</p>
<p>In <a href="#pic36">No. 36</a> the photographer scratched his
initials crudely upon the window-pane;
instantly Jack Frost began to elaborate the
crude work, with much better effect.</p>
<p><a href="#pic37">No. 37</a> is easily suggestive of a strip of
very costly hand-made lace.</p>
<p><a href="#pic38">No. 38</a> is a very beautiful arrangement
showing two distinct types of window-pane
frost. Observe how each type never intrudes
upon another. The white fern-like
type is raised from the glass, and was formed
in a very cold room where it slowly developed
and grew for days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p><a href="#pic39">No. 39</a> is another striking arrangement
of the two types; observe the very delicate
fleecy patterns of the frost which forms
a background for the fern-like scrolls.</p>
<p><a href="#pic40">No. 40</a> shows a perfectly developed fern;
while in <a href="#pic41">No. 41</a> we have a strikingly beautiful
example of a group of ferns; this type
is heavily laid upon the glass, and develops
in zero weather.</p>
<p><a href="#pic42">No. 42</a> shows very clearly, in detail,
the granular formation of the frost which
has drawn away from the true frost crystals
forming in detached places, in order to give
them room to complete their elaborate
patterns.</p>
<p><a href="#pic43">No. 43</a> shows an extremely graceful
feather effect, with beautifully curved scroll
like tips.</p>
<p><a href="#pic44">No. 44</a> is a very striking arrangement of
window frost, showing exquisitely arranged
branches, resembling evergreens, shooting
out into the clear spaces upon the
glass.</p>

<p><a href="#pic49">No. 49</a>. Another arrangement of leaves,
showing also branch-like twigs.</p>
<p><a href="#pic50">No. 50</a>. A very delicate pattern. Note
the perfectly formed leaf design with its
delicate background of feathery tendrils.</p>
<p><a href="#pic51">No. 51</a>. A remarkably fine feathery design.</p>
<p><a href="#pic52">No. 52</a>. Two very freakish specimens of
frost etchings. Suggesting somewhat the

<p><a href="#pic55">No. 55</a>. Perfectly formed leaf designs.</p>
<p><a href="#pic56">No. 56</a>. A design worthy of study. Find
the spider.</p>
<p><a href="#pic57">No. 57</a>. Two types. Suggesting gray
moss clinging to rocks.</p>
<p><a href="#pic58">No. 58</a>. A very rare design. An almost
perfect spider&rsquo;s web, formed of thick, granular
frost, with beautiful moss-like ornamentation
in lighter design.</p>
<p><a href="#pic59">No. 59</a>. One of the choicest and most
delicate designs photographed which might
have formed in the ocean instead of upon
a window-pane. <a href="#pic60">No. 60</a>: this beautiful

<p>Most of us have given little time or
very serious thought to the study
of the snow, and the marvellous detail
which goes to fashion the individual snow
crystal. In fact, if we live in a crowded
city, we are inclined to look upon a heavy
snowfall as something of a nuisance, to be
shovelled and carted away as expeditiously
as may be by the army of men employed
by the city for that purpose. There it lies,
soiled and unlovely, impeding pedestrianism
and traffic, and thoroughly undesirable until
it is cleared away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>But once outside in the open country
we are inclined to gaze forth upon the pure
expanse of snow-covered hill and plain,
resplendent and dazzling as it stretches
afar under the pale winter sunshine, with
a more kindly, tolerant mood; for there we
may view the snow in all its unsullied
charm; and it will surely bring fine sleighing,
we concede, and the children are hilarious
and happy over prospective snow sports.</p>
<p>But I wish to give you a brief glimpse
into a realm of snow which is filled with
charm and mystery, and when you have
looked into that realm and studied for
yourself the marvellous phenomena and
detail of snow-crystal formation, you will
doubtless ever after, when gazing forth
upon a snow-covered expanse, or in watching
the fluttering, swirling flakes as they
descend, exclaim: Oh, the wonder and
mystery of it all! How can it be possible
for such exquisitely beautiful jewelled crystals
to fashion themselves in the vast
spaces of the heavens, among the clouds!</p>

<p>Snow is, in itself, the water in solution,
crystallised into irregular and regular, more
or less geometrical forms and designs, of
which there are two distinct types; the
crystalline and the granular forms. The
granular formations embody a special type,
and the crystalline formations are usually
transparent or ice-like, and vary in size
greatly, some being about three-quarters
of an inch in greater diameter. They
fall either singly or bunched together,
according to whether the temperature and
humidity is high or low.</p>
<p>The structural formation of snow crystals
is generally found to be of hexagonal
shape, usually six-cornered or pointed,
although rare types have been discovered
and photographed where such was not the
case, as the trigonal crystals shown. Snow
crystals have been classified, as to structural
formation, into two types; the tubular
and columnar. The columnar types are
formed of long, slender, needle-like crystals
or columns, usually tapering at one end,
while the tubular crystals are developed
upon an extremely thin tubular plane.
Frequently we find that two types have
united, thus forming the &ldquo;compound&rdquo;
crystal, which is rare, and frequently a
very beautiful, showy snow jewel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The tubular crystals are of more common
occurrence and exhibit greater beauty and
diversity of outline than the plain columnar
types.</p>
<p>The internal formation and design of
the snow crystal is of great importance and
interest, and the delicately etched markings
which occur upon their surfaces, and are so
well brought out in the photo-micrographic
illustrations, are due to certain minute air
inclusions or small air tubes. When the
light falls upon the crystal, these air tubes
appear as dark tracings or lines and shadings
and go to form and carry out the design of
each individual crystal.</p>

<p>During great snowstorms the winds
within such storms blowing spirally inward
toward the storm centre near the earth,
and at the same time upward and outward,
above, exert the vast powers of bringing
together the material, the water vapours,
which in conjunction with the icy breath
of the raging blizzard, perfects the formation
of the snow crystal.</p>
<p>Far above the clouds, in the vast silences
of space, in thinnest air, supported solely
by up-rushing winds, the little snow crystals
form and multiply, embellished and
enlarged by their continual warring contact
with the elements, until at last they descend
earthward.</p>
<p>Many of these beautiful crystals are
doubtless great travellers, for they are
frequently, when first generated in space,
exceedingly light in formation, so much
so that not until they have been buffeted
about repeatedly by the Storm King, do
they gain sufficiently in structure and
in weight to descend. They are gradually
built up and become heavier by
the varying conditions of air pressure,
degrees of humidity, aided also by electric
currents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Often the delicate crystals are handled
so very roughly while passing from cloud
to cloud strata, and violent choppy winds,
that there are frequent collisions and many
of the crystals reach us in a broken,
imperfect state. Perfect crystals are by
no means common, and it requires infinite
patience and skill to capture and photograph
them in perfection. During a great
blizzard or snow-storm, lasting for days,
which one might reasonably hope would be
quite prolific of many perfect specimens,
perhaps only one or two really perfect or
noteworthy crystals may be obtained.</p>
<p>It is only within the past few years
that scientists have been enabled to secure
crystallographs with any degree of success,
so that all early observers of snow-crystal
formation were compelled to rely upon
the magnifying glass for all information
regarding their delicate formation, and crude
drawings were made from such observation
and served to illustrate articles upon the
subject, as shown in the early writings of
Tyndall and others.</p>

<p>It is to Mr. Wilson A. Bentley who is
recognised as the pioneer in crystal photography,
that I am indebted for the wonderfully
beautiful illustrations shown, and
which have been selected with much care,
in order to give as clearly as possible some
idea of the many distinct types and the
formation of crystals produced during given
types of storms or blizzards. Mr. Bentley
has during his many years of valuable
work for the Government along these
lines, secured thirteen hundred distinct
snow crystals. Strangely enough, in all
that time, he has never run across duplicates.
Nature, it seems, is ever versatile
and the rarity of her patterns is practically
inexhaustible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Unlike the mineral crystals, or those
found in the mineral kingdom, which form
beneath the surface of the earth, and are
dependent largely upon their surroundings
and environments for their crystalline formation,
the snow crystal is most ethereal;
born in the vast spaces of the heavens,
fashioned by the changing clouds and
vapours, its lullaby the hoarse crooning of
the mighty blizzard, the little snowflake
is tossed to and fro, now borne to earth
for a brief time, only to be caught upward
and tempest-tossed into space again.
Perhaps this process occurs many times,
for the snowflake is a mere plaything of
the storm, until at last the capricious winds
permit the snowflake to descend. Timidly
and gently it is at last allowed to fall, seeking
a final resting place upon the broad
bosom of Mother Earth.</p>
<p>It is thus that the snow crystal grows
and matures, owing its crystalline formation
entirely to the constant tossing and
warring with the mighty forces of the
storm, and the buffeting which it encounters
upon its long journey earthwards.</p>

<p>It is of course utterly impossible to bring
before you in the photo-micrographs of the
snow crystals all their many charms, their
exquisite hues and rainbow shadings, as
each crystal radiates with prismatic hues
which are due greatly to air inclusions
and resembles closely at times, clusters of
magnificent jewels. We get this effect in
mass, if we gaze forth upon a wide expanse
of snow illuminated by pale moonlight, or
flooded by strong sunshine. The scintillation
is almost too dazzling at times for
the eyes, and we are duly impressed by
the magnitude of snow-crystal formation.
Numberless they are, and like the sands
of the seashore. We find that in making
a collection of snow crystals by photo-micrograph,
during a period covering
twenty years of study, in which thirteen
hundred perfect specimens were found,
that the entire number discovered, when
massed, would form only about one cubic
inch of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>How many millions of these exquisitely
constructed jewels do we heedlessly crush
and shatter unconsciously during a brief
walk in the snow and how crude and
imperfect seem the productions of human
minds and hands when compared to those
formed by the blind forces of nature.</p>
<p>The exquisite and varied types of snow
crystals herein shown, were photographed
in northern Vermont; a locality where the
snow-storms are frequently long and severe
and where the country by-roads are blocked
and impassable for days, while huge drifts
pile high above the fences, and often cover
the windows.</p>

</div>
<p>In these severe winter snow-storms
which our New England poets illustrate
so aptly, we become familiar with the
snow in all its unsullied purity, and if we
are New England born, we never forget
the white, frozen charms of those rigid
winters, no matter where we stray, or how
torrid the sunshine of our abiding place
in later years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Many there are among us who are
familiar with and love that winter idyl, the
wintry landscape&mdash;a blended symphony
of colouring; warm russet browns, gray,
and rich velvety greens. Against the dense
greens of the Hemlock and Spruce, the
sturdy mottled Sycamore branches, with
their little pendent russet balls clinging
tenaciously to their topmost twigs, stand
forth in bold relief, while graceful white
birches, slender and ghost-like, mingle and
blend with the sombre gray trunks of
Chestnut and Birch, which toss and sway
their denuded branches high in the frosty
air.</p>
<p>A cold gray sky&mdash;then stealing down
appear the first silent fluttering snowflakes,
floating gently earthward. A brooding
silence settles over all, unbroken save perhaps
by a straggling flight of crows winging
their way heavily to safe shelter
among the distant forest of dark pines.
Timidly at first descend the first advance
heralds of the great storm, the tiny snowflakes;
then suddenly ever faster and faster
they assemble, until the dreary, leaden
skies and the landscape picture is confused
and merged together in a gray
curtain; shut out by the wildly eddying,
swirling snow.</p>

<p>For the trees which tossed their naked
gnarled branches in the pitiless wind before
the storm have been rejuvenated and clothed
anew in soft white velvet draperies, and the
old gray fence rails gleam and scintillate,
cushioned with snow. It would almost
seem as though nature had endeavoured
to carry out some special decorative
scheme when she draped the evergreens,
for see how beautiful are the Southern
Pines with their brush-like tufts of
needles, each one resembling a snowy
pompon of feathers. The graceful, drooping
Hackmatack tree looks as though the
children had decorated it with strings of
popcorn, the tiny cones at intervals each
touched with a wisp of white snow carrying
out the effect. While the Balsams
wave their serrated branches, each tiny
needle outlined in white, and the stately
Hemlocks bend low their glossy green
boughs, flattened and draped heavily with
snow. In the hedges the thick underbrush
appears for all the world like a field
of ripening cotton, each group of twigs
supporting a whorl of cotton-like snow. No
true New Englander repines or deplores
the desolation of such a scene; to him it
is not a gloomy spectacle, but rather
festive.</p>

<p>Should you wander alone far afield,
perhaps across some hilly pasture where
above the soft snow hummocks last year&rsquo;s
drying seed-pods and grasses gleam frost-touched
and sparkling in the sunshine,
into the edge of the &ldquo;spruce bush,&rdquo; if you
are a lover of nature in all her moods, aside
from the glittering beauties which meet
the eye upon every hand, you will be
impressed by a wonderful calmness, a
brooding silence, which came with the
advent of the snow. This silence is so
impressive that even the velvety pad of
some little furry creature in the underbrush
is startling, and the tapping of the
brave little woodpecker up aloft sounds
stridently keen and obtrusive. It is as
though the storm in passing had left as
a benediction, this great peace which
broods over all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>In tropical countries snow is never
seen, for it does not reach the earth, excepting
that which falls upon lofty mountain
tops. On the summits of very high mountains
the snow occurs intermittently
whether in frigid or tropical zones. Snow
is a wonderfully important factor in the
laws which govern irrigation, for as it
melts upon the tops of mountains it adds
greatly to the watershed or drainage,
flowing into all streams and carrying fertility
to all regions.</p>

<p>Although certain types of snow crystals
may be detected with the naked eye,
most of them are so tiny that their structural
form cannot be determined without the
aid of a microscope. If you chance to be
out of doors during a snowfall, and happen
to wear a dark coat of wool material,
observe closely the flakes which chance to
alight upon your sleeve and perhaps you
may be able to recognise a true crystal.</p>
<p>When, as we sometimes remark, &ldquo;Mother
Goose is shaking out her feather bed,&rdquo;
and the white flakes come drifting down
in large loose feathery flakes, then we
may more readily discover a crystal without
the aid of a glass. It is then that we
find the lace-like, open, branchy and star-like
shapes. These usually form during
a local storm, or from a storm preceded by
a warm wave. But the hard pellet-like
crystals which sting our window-panes in
falling, are from a very high altitude, and
have been great travellers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The study of the snow and its many
mysterious phases is full of surprise and
charm; and its various demonstrations
fascinating and almost unexplainable.
Among the many strange manifestations
encountered in the kingdom of snow,
perhaps there is nothing more mysterious
than the so-called &ldquo;snow rollers.&rdquo; They
are rather a recent discovery among snow
students, and not frequently encountered.
Two good examples of these curious rollers
are given in photograph illustrations. The
photographer came upon them quite unexpectedly
and thought at first that the
children had been amusing themselves
by rolling huge snowballs. But upon
investigation he discovered that these mysterious
bundles of snow were quite hollow,
like a large muff, and scattered at intervals
over a large snow-covered field. These
mysterious snow rollers form only after
a light fluffy snowfall, followed by a rise in
the temperature, from a degree or so
above zero up to 36&deg; or 38&deg; above, accompanied
by a peculiar stray gusty wind.</p>

<p class="caption">86. The Egyptian crystal, because of its characteristic tracings</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The rollers form most frequently in the
foothill regions, wherein these gusty winds
pour over and around the hilltops, and
down across the valleys. After the temperature
has reached 36&deg; to 38&deg; above and
the snow upon the surface of the ground
has been slightly dampened and rendered
sticky, the capricious wind gusts scoop up
here and there small particles of the moist
snow, and overturn them upon that in
front, forming a ridge or hollow arch,
which is the commencement of the snow
roller. Then the wind gets back of it,
and proceeds to roll it forward, until, as
it gradually rolls along it accumulates
more snow, and increases in size, until it
becomes too heavy a plaything for the sport
of the winds, and then it stops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>These snow rollers grow in size both in
diameter and in length, as they roll along,
and attain various sizes from a few inches
in diameter up to two feet in diameter.
Some of the rolls are overturned by the
boisterous winds in such a manner as to
form a hollow snow arch, and hence some
of the rolls are hollow even when matured.
Hundreds of these rather mysterious snow
formations occur to the acre of land, and
they form both on a dead level and upon
inclines.</p>
<p>That snow crystal study is extremely
fascinating is well shown, for Mr. Bentley
declares that although he works out of
doors for hours at a time, when often his
hands are well-nigh frost-bitten by the
intense cold, in below zero weather, yet
he is himself almost unconscious of discomfort
or real suffering from the cold,
so keenly interested and intent is he at the
time, in securing some new and wonderful
type of crystal to add to his already large
collection of snow jewels.</p>

<p>To make a collection of the snow crystals
it is necessary, first of all, to make a
receiving board. This is just a flat board
covered with black velvet or wool material.
The operator then places the board in a
favourable position for catching the flakes
as they descend, and then closely watches
the receiving board as flake after flake
alights upon the black surface. His eye
will become sufficiently trained by experience
at last to detect a fairly perfect
specimen. If such a crystal alights&mdash;and
sometimes it is weary waiting, for in a
storm lasting an entire day, frequently but
two or three perfect crystals deign to alight
upon the receiving board&mdash;but when the
perfect crystal arrives, then with infinite
skill, and just the right touch, which must
be acquired by practice, the little crystal
is gently lifted upon a tiny, sharp-pointed
stick, transferred to the slide and photographed
as quickly as possible, before
it has had an opportunity to dissolve,
and become again a mere drop of uninteresting
moisture. The camera used is
photo-micrographic, or a camera with a
microscopic attachment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Regarding the formation of the snow
into crystalline forms, we are told that the
molecules and atoms of all substances
when allowed freedom of movement, form
themselves into many definite shapes and
designs called crystals. Minerals, gold,
silver, iron, sulphur, when melted and
permitted to cool, gradually show this
crystallising power. And by dissolving saltpetre
in water and allowing the solution to
slowly evaporate, large crystals will form,
more or less symmetrical, as the salt is
converted into vapour. Alum readily crystallises
in the same way. The diamond is
crystallised carbon, and all precious stones
are examples of mineral crystals. It would
be quite an interesting and novel experiment
to photograph some of these crystals
formed of minerals such as saltpetre, alum
and others, and to compare them with
the structural formation of snow crystals.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Water itself as a liquid is to all appearances
formless; when sufficiently cooled,
however, the molecules are brought within
play of the crystallising force, and thus
arrange themselves in more or less attractive
crystals. A most interesting point,
well worthy of consideration, is that it is
extremely improbable that anyone has
as yet found, perhaps never will find, the
one pre&euml;minently beautiful and symmetrical
snow crystal which nature has probably
fashioned in her most artistic mood&mdash;her
masterpiece. The study of this unique
branch of nature work is as yet in its
infancy. It possesses all the charm of
novelty, and many who take it up will
find in it a source of much pleasure as well
as instruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>It would seem that there is really no
limit to the number of distinct forms and
types among the snow crystals. It will
be noted that many of the designs are most
rare and fanciful, and really worthy of
developing and reproducing in many ways.
The open, lace-like types might well be
copied by a jeweller or worker in precious
stones, for nothing could be more exquisite
in a pendant or brooch than one of these snow-crystal
designs carried out in diamonds.
Others suggest rare patterns for lace work
and embroideries, while others are wonderfully
effective pieces of mosaic work, or
suggestive studies for stained window-glass.
Many of the patterns might well serve for
wall-paper or print material designs. And
as a drawing lesson, the simpler forms
might be copied and with their history and
detail, afford a pleasant and profitable
study.</p>
<p>Ideas along these lines it seems to me
are limitless and well worth cultivating.</p>
<p>Again, to quote Whittier, how charmingly
has he portrayed, in the following
lines, the strangely beautiful and mysterious
formation of the ethereal snow
crystal:</p>

<p>That all may know and understand the
life history and formation of the crystals
shown in the photographs, I will give a
brief description of each which you will
doubtless find both interesting and
instructive. It will be seen that each crystal
possesses some individual characteristic
differing entirely from its predecessor, and
each, in its way, fascinating and beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="#pic61">No. 61</a>. A very showy crystal, of local-storm
type, also a blizzard crystal formed
in low, warm altitude.</p>
<p><a href="#pic62">No. 62</a>. This exquisite crystal might well
suggest a jewelled brooch or pendant of
rare workmanship. It began its formation
in a very high altitude, where the solid,
hexagonal centre was formed, started to
descend in plain hexagonal form, but was
caught upwards by the rushing clouds,
tossed about awhile, and then allowed to
pass into a lower, warmer altitude where
its elaborated branches were added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p><a href="#pic63">No. 63</a>. A high, frigid-altitude crystal,

<p><a href="#pic64">No. 64</a>. Remarkable for its six beautiful

structure.</p>
<p><a href="#pic65">No. 65</a>. An exquisitely designed centre,
with air inclusions strongly marked.</p>
<p><a href="#pic66">No. 66</a>. This crystal has been formed of

<p>For who has not at some time in their
lives revelled in the wonderful, joyous
pleasures of skating? The ice crystal-clear
beneath our polished steel, as we
glided bird-like, swiftly over the polished,
mirror-like pond beneath us. What
exhilaration and glow we found in the fascinating
sport. But how seldom, if ever, did
we give a thought to the wonderful formation,
and the beauties of that crystal surface
beneath our flying feet, or did we
dream that every bit of that ice was
cemented and joined together in exquisite
mosaic-like patterns, formed by countless
millions of tiny ice flowers, far too delicate
and small to be seen by the naked eye.
This wonderful process of ice formation
goes on, as Lowell so charmingly writes:</p>

<p>The conversion of liquid water through
freezing into a solid crystalline state is
certainly a most interesting process, as
well as a mysterious one. There are many
more difficulties to be encountered by
crystal photographers in the study of ice
formation, and its minute detail, than in
that of either the snow or frost. Still
many instructive and very interesting experiments
have been made and facts
obtained relating to the formation of the
ice, and it has recently been possible to
secure a valuable set of photographs which
are wonderfully interesting, inasmuch as
they serve to show the singular formation
and development of ice crystal structure
from start to finish.</p>
<p>Ice and water are so optically alike, that
the formation of these ice crystals cannot
be clearly detected without the aid of a
microscope. These ethereal ice flowers are
extremely frail and thin, less than one
one-hundredth of an inch in thickness; and
they vary from just a mere microscopic
speck, to one-third of an inch or so in
tabular diameter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Generally every freezing body of water
contains these beautiful ice crystals; myriads
of tiny transparent ice flowers which
assume distinct types and groups, more or
less symmetrical. In order to watch the
growth and development of these ice crystals
which build up in such quantities on
the surface of pond, river and brook, and
which go, as a whole, to form solid ice,
certain artificial conditions of light are
necessary. These may be simply furnished
by using a small mirror placed in a horizontal
position beneath the surface of the
water which is in process of freezing. Or,
if one wishes to make an interesting study
of the strange phenomena within doors,
it may be quite possible to do so by simply
placing water in a pail, and in the bottom
of the pail, beneath the water, a mirror in
a horizontal position. Of course the water
should be kept in a cold room where it will
freeze, or beneath an open window. The
mirror affords the necessary white background,
and in this manner ice in process of
freezing may be plainly viewed from its
first germ growth to the finished ice crystal.</p>

<p>The process by which each water molecule,
obedient to the great laws which
govern nature, draws together in countless
numbers to form and build themselves
into countless flower-like ice crystals, which
go to form solid ice is a magical, fascinating
process, well worth watching.</p>
<p>The types of ice crystals differ, however,
upon still surfaces, to those which form
upon running or disturbed water. Still,
such a similarity exists in all ice crystal
formation, and their habits of growth, that
one may get a very clear idea of the process
of their development by observing it in
the simple manner above described.</p>
<p>Their different stages of growth is very
clearly divided into five or six types of
crystalline formation, and they pass from
beginning to end, through the various
stages of development as the nuclear, or
smooth-edged crystal, the scalloped, the
ray-like and the branching stages of growth;
after which they lose their individuality
by becoming solidified and merged into
the solid ice form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>When the ice flowers or crystals first
begin to appear, it is usually upon the
surface of the water, and close to the sides
of the pail. Frequently they push out in
long, delicate, needle- or lance-like forms
while upon the plain edges of these sharp
lances, scallops and delicate serrations
quickly follow. But the individual or
flower type of crystals which grow and
scatter themselves over the surface of the
water, do not attach themselves to any
object, but grow in a detached fashion, and
are really the most interesting crystal for
observation and study. These detached
crystals following out the laws which
govern also the frost and snow crystals
from their first stage of development,
form a simple, smooth-edged disc of very
thin transparent ice, gradually merging
into the same, hexagonal, flower-like pattern,
which governs the frost and snow
crystals, although during the first stages
of their development they show no tendency
to follow hexagonal outlines. The photographed
illustrations showing this type
of ice crystal, from its start to finish were
most of them taken from indoor observation.</p>

<p>Beginning with photograph <a href="#pic128">No. 128</a>, we
have the germ or birth, showing the first
stage which the ice crystal assumes in
its formation. It is always seen as a
round disc of very clear, thin ice.</p>
<p><a href="#pic129">No. 129</a> illustrates the second stage of
growth in which the tiny serrations or
scallops are just beginning to shoot out and
form about the germ or disc. Frequently
they remain in this stage of development
for some time without further change,
but when it is zero weather they quickly
increase in growth, and soon begin to show
clearly defined scallops as shown in photograph
<a href="#pic130">No. 130</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>In <a href="#pic131">No. 131</a>, the ice crystal has at last begun
to assume definite form, and its hexagonal
shape is more clearly defined; while
in <a href="#pic132">No. 132</a>, we have the completed flower-like
outline, and in Nos. <a href="#pic133">133</a> and <a href="#pic134">134</a> the
finished ice flower with its air inclusions of
light and shade perfected. This shows the
entire process of growth of the commonest
type of these ice crystals, after which
process they lose their identity and merge
into the solid ice film.</p>
<p>However, ice film growth is not wholly
supported in this manner, for branches
often form upon the under side of the ice
film, and grow downward into the water,
as shown in photograph <a href="#pic135">No. 135</a>, which
is a section of ice with fern-like crystal-growth
growing down into the water, thus
aiding in growth and solidification. Each
type of crystal, and there are five, represents
some different characteristic growth&mdash;the
long, narrow, needle type, the simple stars
of six points, and the spherical or discoidal
forms; also those resembling coral-like
formations.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Photograph <a href="#pic136">No. 136</a> shows how individual
ice flowers hamper each other in growth;
that the points reaching out into clear
water grow and draw to themselves with
greater freedom the water molecules, while
the points intruded upon or crowded out
by other crystals or flowers, cease to grow,
and do not interfere with the growth of
others.</p>
<p>Nos. <a href="#pic137">137</a> and <a href="#pic138">138</a> are still other forms of
ice-growth, the needle-like, lance-like form
which we may frequently observe pushing
out from the banks of a small pond or
brook. These needle-like forms of ice
eventually acquire branches about their
entire radius, which grow and merge, with
other ice flowers of different types, into
solid ice upon the surface of the water.</p>
<p><a href="#pic139">No. 139</a> shows this type of ice-crystal
completed. These ice-crystals form and
rise like magic in early winter, especially
upon and around the new ice upon the edges
of small brooks, and streams.</p>

<p class="t0">Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief</p>

</div>
<p>Another very interesting example of
ice-growth and formation which we occasionally
discover upon the window-panes,
and which should not be confounded with
the frost work etchings, as it is in reality
a thin transparent ice film, which frequently
assumes exquisite formations and
patterns. In <a href="#pic141">No. 141 <i>a</i></a> the coral-like
branch is a beautiful example of this
window-pane ice, while upon the same
pane of glass in precisely the same temperature
we find another type, as <a href="#pic141b">141 <i>b</i></a> resembling
somewhat the transparent wing
of an insect. There are but two distinct
types of the ice film etchings, and they
are classified as the feather form and the
arborescent types. It is presumed that
the forming of types is largely governed
by the varying thickness of the glass upon
which the ice film is deposited, and to the
presence or absence of minute frozen
particles of ice beneath the film. The
feather form seems to develop upon
cooler positions of the glass, and where
the water film is thinnest.</p>

<p>Nos. <a href="#pic142">142</a>, <a href="#pic143">143</a>, and <a href="#pic144">144</a> are all rare examples
of window ice. No. 16 shows to
perfection a greatly magnified section of
the coral-like tracings in detail. This window-pane
ice, unlike the frost etchings, is
always transparent or opaque water ice.</p>
<p>The ice pictures form in rather an exclusive
fashion, and two types never intrude
upon each other&rsquo;s territory, although
we often find both types upon one pane
of glass, as shown in the photographed
illustration Nos. <a href="#pic140">140 <i>a</i></a> and <a href="#pic140b">140 <i>b</i></a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The ice films always begin to develop
upon the colder portions of the glass first.
Feathery plume-like designs form first upon
shaded portions, and slowly follow the
fading sunlight as it passes from one pane
to another, until the entire window is
often covered with these transparent ice
pictures. During zero weather the feathery
types thicken to an astonishing degree,
more so than the opposite type, or arborescent
ice film.</p>
<p>Another type of ice formation, and an
interesting one, which in the photograph
resembles somewhat a vegetable root or
growth, is a form of ice which develops
and grows upon and under peaty soil.
These singular little ice columns rise as by
magic, and form a miniature forest of tiny
ice columns; frequently raising upon their
tops the soil, stones, etc., to a height of
many inches.</p>

ice, <a href="#pic147">No. 147</a> being a largely magnified
section of one of these tiny columns
in detail. Icicles are another interesting
phenomenon belonging to ice study.
They are evidently produced by the thawing
of snow, and we frequently discover
&ldquo;freak&rdquo; icicles hanging pendent from the
house eaves during a thaw. They are, in a
way, one of the many mysteries pertaining,
and to be classed as ice crystallisations, and
are closely related to the wonderful stalactite
formations found in deep caves.</p>
<p>Beautiful beyond powers of description
are the magical, fairy-like scenes which
follow the passing of a great ice-storm.
If you are out of doors just after such a
storm, when the first rays of the sun begin
to shine forth, lighting and touching every
ice-sheathed twig with gold, and before
the ice has begun to melt and fall from the
trees, you can well imagine that you are
catching a fleeting glimpse of fairyland!
Trees that before the storm waved their
leaf-stripped branches, bare and unlovely,
in wailing symphony, tuned by the bleak
wintry blast, have suddenly been clothed
anew and made beautiful for a brief time,
by their silvery coating of ice. Each tiny
twig glitters and scintillates and crackles
beneath the pale wintry sunshine; beautiful
beyond words to picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>These ice-storms occur more frequently
in January, and are usually followed by
a warm wave. They are seen in all their
beauty in the New England States. Frequently
after such an ice-storm there is a
noticeable swelling and expansion of twigs
and buds; the first suggestion of verdure
and an early spring.</p>
<p>It is intended in this article but to touch
upon the simple structural formation of
the ice. There are still many important
facts to discover, many interesting problems
to solve. It would be interesting
to know why the ice crystals which originate
and have their being in the same body of
water, and under precisely the same conditions
of temperature vary so greatly in
their structural formation.</p>

and rain, comes on apace; and the
bluebird, that &ldquo;comes first you know, like a
violet that has taken wings,&rdquo; has piped
his clear advance notes in the hedges,
and a bright message of promise his cheery
song always brings, of blossoms and verdure
soon to follow.</p>
<p>Surely each changing month brings with
its advent its own peculiar charms. The
seasons of frost, snow and ice are full of
beauty to those of us who have looked into,
and delight to ponder over, the many
secret ways of nature. But April with
its sudden showers, which eventually do
bring forth the May flowers, we hail with
hope; and are only too happy to leave
behind us, as a pleasant remembrance, the
more sombre, frozen charms of winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>The ice-bound brooks have at last burst
their fetters, in the meadows by the little
streams the stems of the willows are
yellowing, and here and there the pussy
willows, in their silver, furry coats, are
bursting forth; the alders have sprouted,
and from the ooze of the marshes the
swamp-cabbages are pushing forth their
sharp-pointed purple sprouts. While the
honking geese, flock after flock, trail wedge-like
in the early mists of the morning,
across the gray skies. In the sedgy places
where the flags are just sprouting the
&ldquo;peepers&rdquo; at twilight begin their spring
chorus, and with the advent of all these
signs of advancing spring, we realise that
the &ldquo;backbone of winter&rdquo; has fairly been
broken, and the earth is preparing and
waiting for April, with its beneficent
showers to bring new life into all dormant
buds and vegetation beneath the earth
and to arouse them once more from their
long winter&rsquo;s lethargy.</p>

</div>
<p>Since the rain plays such an important
role in nature&rsquo;s plans, certain facts concerning
its origin, and the clouds which
govern its formation and fall, will prove
of interest.</p>
<p>The prior causes of rain are due to the
evaporation of moisture which is constantly
going on, from ocean, lake and river,
and all vegetation; until the air is freely
saturated with moisture thus evaporated.
Then &ldquo;Mother Nature&rdquo; assists, causing
turbulent, driving winds to rise, and all
her elements combine forthwith, to precipitate
the moisture; and then follows
the rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The rays of the sun falling upon the air
stratum nearest the earth cause it to
arise and expand. Thus, as a result, the
clouds are formed. The ascending air
leaves a partial vacuum below, which
causes surrounding air to rush inward;
which in turn causes winds. Once this
process starts, it tends to grow and perpetuate
itself. The inrushing air below
forces the rising air still higher and higher,
which causes dense clouds to form and rush
upwards to great heights. Both snow
and rain fall as a result of warm moist
air being forced upward to a great altitude,
and its moisture condensed.</p>
<p>The smaller raindrops fall from the
lower cloud strata, but the larger drops
descend from a much higher altitude. In
the higher, frigid altitudes where snow,
and the granular snow pellets are formed
and exist, in the upper sections of the
clouds; by falling down through the vast
cloud regions below, they gradually collect
minute cloud particles, and smaller drops
in their travels, and thus, by melting,
as they encounter warmer air currents,
form the very large, high-altitude raindrops.</p>

<p>It has not until quite recently been
possible to measure with any degree of
accuracy, and photograph raindrops in
the exact size in which they fall. But
now that it has become possible to do this,
it is most interesting to know the process.
It is also most important to be able to
know that certain types of raindrops fall
during given storms. For instance, a very
large type of raindrop emanates from a
violent thunder-storm, when there is vivid
lightning. Another distinct type belongs
to the general storm, and there are many
others, their form and size being governed
entirely by the clouds and the character
of the storms from which they fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Hundreds of samples of raindrop impressions
have recently been secured, and
the method employed to collect and photograph
them is most unique. To secure
these raindrop impressions, emanating from
various storms and clouds, a shallow tin
receptacle about four inches in diameter
was used, the bottom of the tin being
covered with fine, uncompacted flour an
inch deep. The flour was then exposed
to the rain for about four seconds, and the
raindrops allowed to remain in the flour
until each drop had hardened as it fell.
These dough pellets, or raindrop impressions
were found, in every instance, to
correspond very closely in size to the raindrops
as they fell. When thoroughly dried
out they were carefully removed from their
bed of flour, labelled and photographed.
This method of determining the relative
dimensions of raindrops which fall during
various types of storms, has proven to be
the most satisfactory method as yet discovered.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The large raindrops are invariably
great travellers. The larger the drops
the greater the height from which they fell.
Some of them travel a distance of five
to eight miles before reaching the earth.</p>
<p>Raindrops falling from very high altitudes
invariably start out as snowflakes,
as the upper section of a rain-cloud, when
formed in the high frigid altitudes, is
usually composed of snow. The general
rain-storm usually furnishes small to
medium-sized drops. But sudden thunder-storms,
where the clouds gather in dense,
mountain-like formations, as the one shown
in the photographed illustration, furnish
the very largest raindrops which fall,
unless we except those which may sometimes
result from the melting of large
hailstones, which emanate sometimes from
very violent storms of the whirling, tornado
type.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>The cold gray rains of early spring,
which frequently turn to ice in falling,
and sheathe the branches of trees with a
glittering coat of icy mail, change in character
as spring and the warmer weather
advances.</p>
<p>The mid-summer thundershower is still
another type, and an impressive one. When
all nature lies gasping and parched under
the withering heat of a torrid sun, when
the pebbly beds of the little streams are
brown and dry, and the thirsty cattle low
plaintively in the sun-scorched pastures,
then suddenly, the south winds send a
long-drawn, whispering sigh through the
motionless tree-tops; the poplar leaves
begin to tremble and toss, and faster
and faster the thunder heads begin to roll
up and assemble, and rush together, with
low ominous mutterings.</p>
<p>The clouds, coppery-hued and black,
and full of menace, hang low, and almost
seem to touch the hills, rising winds chase
each other and catch up stray dead leaves
and d&eacute;bris, sending them whirling and
dancing in fantastic eddies; while the
startled swallows wheel low before the
rushing, mighty tumult of the approaching
storm.</p>

<p>Nothing can compare in grandeur, to
the marshalling of Nature&rsquo;s forces together
and the raging fury of a great thunder-storm.
Truly the roar of the thunder
may well be likened to Heaven&rsquo;s artillery,
and no pyrotechnic display ever equals
that which the jagged, forked lightning
creates amid the inky, ominous clouds of
the heavens. And then the finale; the
low, distant, retreating growls of the passing
thunder, the gradual lifting of the clouds,
and then like magic, their leaden, ominous
curtains are swept aside, and the happy
sunshine is with us again, and the earth,
refreshed and purified by the grateful
shower, gasps no more in the throes of heat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>And how lovely is nature after such a
shower. How sweet and fresh the air,
and how each blade of grass, and all vegetation
sparkles and scintillates anew. The
little mountain torrent which trickled so
listlessly, just a mere silver thread among
its mossy stones, has gained new courage
and strength since the shower, and its
gurgling may plainly be heard as it now
rushes madly down the incline. The meadow
brook has overflowed its banks,
and formed a miniature lake, in which the
grateful cattle stand contentedly knee-deep.
All the birds rejoice, and the robins,
noisiest of them all, pause to plume afresh
their wet feathers, and pipe their peculiar
rain song; a distinct note of gratitude and
joy for the coming of the rain.</p>
<p>The rain, besides playing a most important
part in aiding all vegetation, is an
acknowledged and powerful agent in the
cleansing and purification of the atmosphere.
Foul air is dissipated, and dust
and particles which rise in clouds and
permeate the air we breathe, are beaten
to the earth and dissipated by the kindly
rain.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Storms which arise in pleasant summer
weather are frequently caused by the diurnal
breezes which ascend mountain slopes
causing sudden clouds to assemble, and
thunder-storms to follow. Violent thunder-storms
are caused by the intensely hot air
which arises from the earth in summer,
and which encounters the cooler air
descending.</p>
<p>Frequently &ldquo;heat lightning&rdquo; may be
observed flickering fitfully in the skies,
when there is no rain. When such is the
case, you may be assured that a storm
cloud hovers somewhere in that direction,
although it may not be visible, or its
thunder audible. Whenever the lightning
is brilliant and continuous the storm is
sure to be of a violent character, when
frequently the destructive bolts are fifty
miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>The rainbow, that wonderfully beautiful
bow of prismatic tints, which sometimes
throws its ethereal arch across the
heavens for a brief while, is caused by the
reflection of the sun&rsquo;s rays shining upon
drops of rain, the colours being arranged
in definite order; red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet. The lunar
rainbow, which occasionally forms at night
when the moon shines, is not of frequent
occurrence, but very beautiful when it
does deign to show itself. Its colouring
is not nearly as distinct at the rainbow,
but ghostly, and of a pale-yellowish tint.
Frequently a double rainbow is seen after
a shower; this is but a reflection of the rainbow
proper, but indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>In the coming of the rainbow we have
a Biblical symbol. It is spoken of in
Genesis, and was used as a token of the
Covenant; as a Divine promise to man,
that the earth should never again be
destroyed by flood.</p>
<p>There are numberless so-called signs,
which are considered reliable indications
of rain. Almost invariably a continuous
south wind will, in most localities, bring
in its wake rain in a few days. On the
contrary, a continuous north wind is liable
to dispel all rain signs for a time.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>A &ldquo;mackerel sky,&rdquo; that is, a sky covered
with a wide expanse of small silvery clouds,
round in shape, is another rather sure
indication of rain; salmon-coloured, leaden,
or silvery clouds are usually indications
of falling weather, and when at sunset
the clouds of the west are brightly coloured,
red or flame-coloured, afterwards followed
by lighter hues, streaking up from the
place where the sun disappeared, and
stretching far across the sky, finally converging
to a common point on the opposite
horizon, you may be quite certain that
somewhere within line of the sun, there is
a heavy storm brewing; although it may
be invisible, and hidden by the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>We know that in certain parts of the
earth the rain seldom falls. In Lima
(Peru), Thebes (Egypt), and in certain
sections of North Africa they very rarely
have rain. The presence of forests tends
to increase the rainfall. Over the ocean
it is always clear when the trade winds are
blowing steadily, while rains fall continuously
in the zone of calms.</p>
<p>Some countries are rarely free from rains;
in Hindustan, Brazil and Guadeloupe the
rain is almost continuous, while certain
localities are noted for prolonged seasons
of either drought or rain, which occur at
stated periods, as in California.</p>
<p>The benefits derived from the rain are
unlimited. After the visitation of a great
and prolonged drought, when lakes and
rivers and their many tributaries, the little
mountain torrents which feed them, are
dry for lack of rain; when the gardens
and all vegetation at last succumb and
shrivel for lack of moisture; when we
really endure great bodily privation,
and domestic animals suffer for lack of
water, then we may realise fully, what
a wise and necessary provision the rain is
to us.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>It seems therefore that there is always
a great promise and hope embodied in
the providential falling of the rain at such
a crisis; nothing can express the thought
I would convey more clearly than the
following beautiful lines:</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
